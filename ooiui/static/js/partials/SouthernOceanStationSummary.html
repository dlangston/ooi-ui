            <p>The global component of the OOI design includes a network of moorings at critical, yet under sampled, high-latitude locations such as within the Southern Ocean, southwest of Chile. Moorings located in the Southern Ocean will support sensors for measurement of air-sea fluxes of heat, moisture and momentum, and physical, biological and chemical properties throughout the water column. The array will have a combination of fixed platforms (moorings) with moored profilers to address the requirement to sample the full water column and mobile platforms (gliders) that will provide simultaneous spatial and temporal sampling capabilities. The array will have a combination of fixed platforms (moorings) with moored profilers to address the requirement to sample the full water column and mobile platforms (gliders) that will provide simultaneous spatial and temporal sampling capabilities. The array will be composed of a Surface Mooring containing fixed instruments situated on the buoy and through the top 1500 m of the water column. A subsurface Global Profiler Mooring made up of two wire-following profilers, one operating from 310 m to 2,445 m and the other 2,470 m to 4,605 m. Two Flanking Moorings will be deployed to form a triangular array ~50 km on a side. These Moorings have their uppermost flotation at ~30 m depth and instruments at discrete depths along the mooring line. Open-Ocean Gliders will be equipped with acoustic modems to relay data from the Flanking Moorings to shore via satellite telemetry. Some gliders will sample within and around the triangular array, while others will sample the upper water column near the Global Profiler Mooring. These gliders will carry sensor suites (see below) with the capability to alter sampling rates during a mission.</p>
