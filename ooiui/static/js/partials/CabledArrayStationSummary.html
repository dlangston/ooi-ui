            The Cabled Array provides unprecedented power (10 kV, 8 kW) and bandwidth (10 GbE) to scientific sensor arrays on the seafloor and throughout the water column. Water column sensors are deployed on moorings with instrumented wire-following profilers, 200-m instrumented platforms, and winched profilers. A shore station in Pacific City, Oregon includes two cable landings serving key sites on the Cabled Array: Slope Base, Southern Hydrate Ridge, Axial Seamount, Axial Base, and the Endurance Array â€“ Oregon Line. The ~ 900 km of modified telecommunications cable (installed in 2012) provides high power and bandwidth to seven Primary Nodes: PN1A (Slope Base), PN1B (Southern Hydrate Ridge), PN3A (Axial Base), PN3B (Axial Seamount), and PN5A (Mid-Plate). The last two primary nodes, PN1C and PN1D, extend from Southern Hydrate Ridge and are part of the Coastal Scale Nodes (CSN) Endurance Oregon Line. The Primary Nodes convert the high power voltage (10 kV) of the primary cable to a lower (375 V) level and distributes it to Science Ports along with communications and timing signals.
