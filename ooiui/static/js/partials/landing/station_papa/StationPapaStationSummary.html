            <p>The global component of the OOI design includes a network of moorings at critical, yet under-sampled, high-latitude locations such as Station Papa in the North Pacific.&nbsp; The array at Station Papa will be occupied in coordination with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which maintains a surface mooring there. As one of the oldest oceanic time series sites, with surveying conducted in the area since 1949, Station Papa has been an important location in the global network of OceanSITES.&nbsp; OOI is designed to add to the existing infrastructure at Station Papa by adding three additional moorings to the area as well as mobile platforms (gliders) to sample in the space between the moorings.&nbsp; The Global Profiler Mooring is composed of two Wire-Following Profilers, one operating from 307 m to 2,174 m and the other 2,195 m to 4,061 m.&nbsp; Two Flanking Moorings will be deployed to form a triangular array ~40 km on a side. These Moorings have their uppermost flotation at ~20 m depth and instruments at discrete depths along the mooring line. Open-Ocean Gliders will be equipped with acoustic modems to relay data from the Flanking Moorings to shore via <em>satellite telemetry.&nbsp; Some gliders </em>will sample within and around the triangular array, while others will sample the upper water column near the Global Profiler Mooring. These gliders will carry sensor suites (see below) with the capability to alter sampling rates during a mission.</p>
            <p>In July 2013, the first of the OOI infrastructure was deployed at Station Papa, including â€“ one Global Profiler Mooring, two Mesoscale Flanking Moorings and three Global Gliders, totaling 57 instruments. <a href="http://tdp.oceanobservatories.org/alfresco/d/d/workspace/SpacesStore/fd2ae21b-8f89-4c9d-b0ab-1539d4690268/3203-00020_Station_PAPA_Global_Array_Deployment_Cruise_Report.pdf" title="Click here to read the July 2013 Station Papa Deployment Cruise Report" target="_blank">Click here to read the July 2013 Station Papa Deployment Cruise Report</a>.</p>
