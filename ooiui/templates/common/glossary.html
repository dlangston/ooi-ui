<h2><a name="1"></a>AUV</h2>
<p>Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are propellor-driven mobile assets. The underwater flight pattern of the AUV can be controlled from shore, making these robots well suited for sampling rapidly changing conditions as their flight pattern can be controlled from shore. Seafloor-mounted docking stations allow AUVs to be deployed for extended time periods.</p>

<h2><a name="2"></a>Benthic Experiment Package</h2>
<p>A Benthic Experiment Package (BEP) is a type of cabled infrastructure, specifically deployed along the shallow continental shelf. BEPs are either connected to a Junction Box to receive power as well as transmit data and communications.</p>

<h2><a name="3"></a>Glider</h2>
<p>Gliders are buoyancy-driven mobile assets. They change their buoyancy by drawing in water through their nose making their front end heavy causing them to sink through the water. To float back up to the surface, they push the water out. Their wings provide lift allowing the gliders to move forward as they change depth. Due to their efficient design, with no need for propellors or an engine, gliders can be deployed for several months at a time.</p>

<h2><a name="4"></a>Interface Controller</h2>
<p>N/A</p>


<h2><a name="5"></a>Junction Box</h2>

<p>A Junction Box (JBox) rests on the seafloor and is connected to shore via a series of fiber optic cables. Several instruments can be attached to a single Jbox and Jboxes can be connected to each other. Jboxes draw energy from the cables to power instruments and to transmit data from the instruments back to shore. In this way, Jboxes act like both a power strip and a converter. The OOI employs three kinds of Jboxes: Low Voltage (LV) Node, Low-Power (LP) Jbox, and Medium Power (MP) JBox. LV Nodes convert high power from the primary node to a lower power that can then be distributed LP or MP Jboxes and cabled moorings. LV Nodes cannot directly connect to instruments. LP Jboxes directly connect to instruments and receive power from LV Nodes. LP Jboxes convert power from LV Nodes into the appropriate power for their associated instruments. The MP Jbox can draw power from either a primary node or a LV Node as well as connect directly to instruments and other Jboxes. The MP Jbox converts high power from the primary node to a lower, medium-level power that that can then be distributed to other nodes.</p>

<h2><a name="59"></a>Horizontal Electric Field, Pressure and Inverted Echo Sounder</h2>
<p>The Horizontal Electrometer-Pressure-Inverted Echosounder (HPIES) is an instrument that utilizes a bottom pressure sensor, an inverted echosounder and a horizontal electrometer to provide insights into the vertical structure of current fields, near-bottom water currents, and water properties including temperature, salinity, and specific volume anomalies.</p>

<h2><a name="60"></a>5-Beam, 600 kHz Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (= 50 m range)</h2>
<p>The 5-Beam, 600 kHz Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (= 50 m range) uses acoustics to measure 3D water-current velocity for a small volume of the water column 50 meters above or below the sensor at resolutions that are appropriate to estimate turbulence parameters. High frequency sound waves emitted by the profiler scatter off suspended particles and back to the sensor. The sensor calculates velocity by measuring changes in these sound waves (i.e., Doppler shifts). This instrument is also referred to as an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP).</p>
<h2><a name="61"></a>Velocity Profiler (short range) for mobile assets</h2>
<p>Velocity Profiler (short range) for mobile assets uses acoustics to measure 3D water-current velocity for a small volume of the water column above or below the sensor. High frequency sound waves (75- to 600-kHz) emitted by the profiler scatter off suspended particles and back to the sensor. The sensor calculates velocity by measuring changes in these sound waves (i.e., Doppler shifts). This instrument is also referred to as an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP).</p>

<h2><a name="62"></a>Velocity Profiler (long range)</h2>
<p>Velocity Profiler (long range) uses acoustics to measure 3D water-current velocity for a small volume of the water column above or below the sensor. The long range sensor is able to measure the current 500 meters or greater from the sensor. High frequency sound waves (75- to 600-kHz) emitted by the profiler scatter off suspended particles and back to the sensor. The sensor calculates velocity by measuring changes in these sound waves (i.e., Doppler shifts). This instrument is also referred to as an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP).</p>

<h2><a name="63"></a>Velocity Profiler (short range)</h2>
<p>Velocity Profiler (short range) uses acoustics to measure 3D water-current velocity for a small volume of the water column above or below the sensor. The short range sensor is able to measure the current 300 meters or greater from the sensor. High frequency sound waves (75- to 600-kHz) emitted by the profiler scatter off suspended particles and back to the sensor. The sensor calculates velocity by measuring changes in these sound waves (i.e., Doppler shifts). This instrument is also referred to as an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP).</p>

<h2><a name="64"></a>3-D Single Point Velocity Meter</h2>
<p>A 3-D Single Point Velocity Meter measures the fluctuating velocity (speed and direction) of water moving past the sensor and platform motion on moving profilers in three-dimensions (u,v,w).</p>

<h2><a name="65"></a>Single Point Velocity Meter</h2>
<p>A Single Point Velocity Meter measures the mean velocity (speed and direction) of water in two-dimensions (U & V) as it moves past the sensor.</p>
<h2><a name="66"></a>3-Axis Motion Pack</h2>
<p>The 3-Axis Motion Pack is a motion sensor located on a surface buoy used to measure its stability as well as other engineering parameters.</p>
<h2><a name="67"></a>Modem acoustic</h2>
<p>The Modem Acoustic facilitates data communication between underwater instruments and the surface. These instruments are found on mooring risers, profilers, and gliders.</p>
